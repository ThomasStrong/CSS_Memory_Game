## Instructions

The app is hosted at [GitHub Pages](https://thomasstrong.github.io/CSS_Memory_Game/) or, will need to be run locally via development server.

## Overview

This project began as a way to experiment with CSS and quickly evolved into a sandbox of manipulating CSS with JavaScript. I also thought this simple game could be something that my child could play.

## Technologies

```
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
```

## Future Development

```
- Needs to show cards on match
- Match colors to icons (?); update icons (?)
- Scoring, +/- high scores
```

## Contributions

This is ultimately a personal sandbox and for my own education and experimenting. That being said, please fork this as you wish and see what you can come up with. I would love to see what you create!
