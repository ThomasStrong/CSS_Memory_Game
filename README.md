## Overview

```
This project began as a way to experiment with CSS and quickly evolved into a sandbox of manipulating CSS with JavaScript.  I also thought this simple game could be something that my child could play.
```

## Future Development

This is ultimately a personal sandbox and for my own education and experimenting.  That being said, please fork this as you wish and see what you can come up with.  I would love to see what you create!
